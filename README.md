# Feast or Famine Tattoo Shop

### React w/ Vite (CVA)

---

---

Site using React for a tattoo shop adapted from the one I made for a notary in 2021. Originally had routes, but not enough content to be more than one page and a form modal yet.

If you want to demo, API keys go in `.env.development`

TODO (20240510):

---

- Form modal - modal works, form needs a lot of work. They wand a really lengthy, detailed thing for consent and disclosures. Could leave library `formik` for `mobx`
- Update the `php` server-side form mailer
- `gcaptcha` needs wiring
- Payment portal (bolt-on, like `Paypal` or `Stripe`)
- analytics + storage
